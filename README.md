# Combinations_Semba
c++ algorithm generating combinations with and without repeating, and Semba algorithm implementation

Inputs: n - number of the elements in the set, k* - number of the elements in the generated subsets 

*not needed in Semba algorithm which generates all possible subsets

Output: sequence of all generated subsets where each number is a representation of number's position in a given set
